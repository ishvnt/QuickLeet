# QuickLeet

QuickLeet is designed to simplify and automate the process of solving LeetCode problems in your preferred IDE. Currently supporting C++, the extension generates a clean and structured boilerplate code, exporting the problem description, along with relevant test cases, into a downloadable file. This tool is ideal for developers looking to work on LeetCode challenges without having to put up with the crappy LeetCode editor, allowing them to easily set up their local environment with all necessary details.

## Key Features:

**-Boilerplate Code Generation**: Automatically generates a ready-to-use code template for C++ solutions, including function signature and necessary imports.  
**-Problem Description Export**: Exports the problem statement and constraints in a clear, formatted file to help you understand the task offline.  
**-Test Case Export**: Retrieves sample test cases for the problem and organizes them in a file, providing you with the data needed to test your solution.  
**-Streamlined Workflow**: Focus on coding without worrying about setup. Just click to generate and start solving.
